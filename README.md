# DSA_TOOLKIT
An interactive web-based visualization tool for Sorting and Searching Algorithms. Built using **HTML**, **CSS (TailwindCSS)**, and **JavaScript**, this toolkit helps users understand how different algorithms work through animations and time/space complexity info.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎨 Visually appealing dark-themed interface
- 📊 Bar chart visualization of sorting process
- 🔍 User input or random array support
- ⏱️ Real-time sorting visualization
- 💡 Time and space complexities shown per algorithm
- ✅ Output of sorted array shown clearly
- 🔜 Coming Soon: Searching algorithms (Linear, Binary Search)

## 🧮 Algorithms Included

### ✅ Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

> Time and space complexities are dynamically displayed.
